Here are a few common problems and some advice:

<TABLE BORDER="2">
<TR>
  <TD>
    The compiler can't find the C++ header files.
  </TD>
  <TD>
    The first step is to make sure that you have the C++ libraries installed on your
    system.  Contact your system administrator if you are unsure about that.
    Secondly, the way you include files is implementation dependent.  This site uses
    examples that work with GNU's C++ compiler, g++, which is included with RedHat Linux.  
    Some systems may require slightly different include statements - for example, 
    instead of
    <BR>
    <TT>
      #include &lt;stl_bitset.h&gt; 
    </TT>
    <BR>
    you might try
    <BR>
    <TT>
      #include &lt;bitset&gt;
    </TT>
  </TD
</TR>
</TABLE>
