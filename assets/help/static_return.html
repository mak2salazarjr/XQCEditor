<H3>Watch out.</H3>
This function returns a variable that is statically located, and therefore overwritten
each time this function is called.  If you want to save the return value of this function,
you should manually save it elsewhere.
<BR>
Of course, when you save it elsewhere, you should make sure to actually copy the
value(s) of this variable to another location.  If the return value is a struct, you
should make a new struct, then copy over the members of the struct.
